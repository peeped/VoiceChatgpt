This is a simple demo that utilizes tts-1, whisper, and gpt3.5-turbo for chatting!

To modify the model, you can edit the chat function in inc.php.

The frontend is built using bootstrap, vue2, and recorder.

Users can upload mp3 format files to PHP, which then calls tts to generate opus audio to ensure efficiency.

Access clean.php to clean up cache files.

Please note that the putenv function needs to be enabled.
